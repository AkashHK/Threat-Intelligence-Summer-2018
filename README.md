# Threat-Intelligence-Summer-2018
The developed threat intelligence model is primarily focussed on ensuring security from future attacks.  This model takes in data describing past malicious connections and learns to recognise such connections through machine learning.  The system is also provided with real time system connections through the ‘tcpdump’ data .Using statistical techniques the model forecasts data describing future connections. This data is analysed and on recognising any potential threat is immediately blocked. This ensures that the computer system remains safe from future attacks.
